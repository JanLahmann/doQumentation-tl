This is a popular technique that we've had a lot of recent success with. The idea behind ZNE might be a bit surprising \u2014 we actually add noise on top of what's already there! But this allows us to extrapolate in the reverse direction, to predict what the results would look like if there were less and less noise."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Adding noise can be accomplished in a few different ways. For instance, we can stretch out the gates to make them longer and thus, more prone to error, or run more gates that ultimately result in an identity operation, so the circuit doesn't change functionally but we purposefully sample more noise. You do have to do this for every circuit and every expectation value you want to keep track of, though \u2014 so you can see how it can end up being computationally expensive."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"One specific type of ZNE is called Probabilistic Error Amplification (PEA). Once we've learned a noise model for a gate, PEA works by sampling errors from that noise model and deliberately injecting them into the circuit. This isn't available in Qiskit yet, but it will be later this year."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The final form of error mitigation we'll discuss is Probabilistic Error Cancellation (PEC). Instead of being at the 3rd resilience level, PEC is a special capability you must turn on manually in Qiskit, because the required computational resources don't scale very well compared to the other error mitigation techniques. You begin by learning about the noise that's affecting your circuit \u2014 run noise-learning or noise-characterization circuits for each unique layer of two-qubit gates in your circuit. These results let you describe the noise in terms of Pauli operators. Once you know these noise terms, you can modify your circuits so that they effectively have the opposite Pauli gates built in to cancel these noise channels. In some ways, the process is similar to the way noise-cancelling headphones work. However, this way of undoing the noise is very costly, with a time to run that grows quickly and exponentially in the number of gates, so it may not be the best choice for a very large circuit."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.h3,{id:"post-process",children:"Post-process"}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The post-process stage is where we visualize and analyze the output of our quantum circuit.
