There are two subtleties to this: two-qubit gates have much higher error rates than single-qubit gates, so one can often ignore the single-qubit depth. Further, not all qubits on a quantum chip are directly connected. Sometimes information has to be swapped from qubit to qubit in order to perform the required entanglements and this swapping process itself requires two-qubit gates. That swapping is handled in a process called "transpilation", a complex process that serves other purposes as well; this is discussed in more detail in the next lesson. The relevant limiting quantity is thus the transpiled two-qubit depth. The exact maximum depth at which high-fidelity results can be obtained depends on the circuit.
